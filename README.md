# Banglore home price prediction
This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. Following are the major steps for this project.
- [x] Build a model using sklearn and trying various ML algorithm using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. 
- [x] Write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. 
- [x] Build a website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. 

During model building I have covered almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. 

Technology and tools wise this project covers, 
1. Python
2. Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Sklearn for model building
5. Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
6. Python flask for http server
7. HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
